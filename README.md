# Minor Planet Center Reader #

## Overview ##
This library provides a way to read the Minor Planet Center Catalogues of Minor Planets.

## Setup ##

Currently we don't have a maven repo hosting this so you will need to build the jars your self.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/wselwood/MinorPlanetCenterReader.git
$ cd MinorPlanetCenterReader
$ ./gradlew jar
```

The jar will end up in build/libs/

If you want source and java doc jars you can run ```./gradlew javadocJar``` and ```./gradlew sourcesJar```

Place the jar in your applications class path as with any other dependency not pulled from maven.
